# BeamLine Scheduler - Marketing Copy

## LinkedIn Post (Professional Network)

🚀 **Excited to share BeamLine Scheduler** - a high-performance distributed workflow orchestration platform I've been working on!

**What is it?**
BeamLine intelligently routes and executes complex workflows across specialized worker nodes with production-grade reliability.

**The Polyglot Approach:**
Instead of forcing everything into one language, we used the right tool for each job:
• Erlang/OTP for fault-tolerant routing
• C for ultra-low latency gateway (<1ms)
• C++ Actor Framework for compute-intensive tasks
• Rust for safe, concurrent task execution
• Phoenix LiveView for real-time UI

**Production-Ready:**
✅ Prometheus metrics + OpenTelemetry tracing
✅ 10K+ req/s throughput per gateway instance
✅ Kubernetes-native with health checks
✅ Multi-tenant with resource isolation
✅ Comprehensive test coverage + CI/CD

**Perfect for:**
Data pipelines, microservices choreography, event-driven architectures, distributed computing

## Cover Letter Snippet

One of my recent projects, **BeamLine Scheduler**, demonstrates my ability to architect and build production-grade distributed systems. Rather than constraining the solution to a single language, I designed a polyglot architecture where each component uses the optimal technology:

- **Erlang/OTP** for the routing layer, leveraging its renowned fault tolerance
- **C** for the API gateway, achieving sub-millisecond latency
- **C++ with the Actor Framework** for compute-intensive workloads
- **Rust** for worker execution, ensuring memory safety and concurrency
- **Phoenix LiveView** for the real-time management UI

The result is a system that handles 10,000+ requests per second with comprehensive observability, multi-tenant isolation, and production-ready reliability. The project showcases my skills in system design, performance optimization, polyglot development, and cloud-native architectures.

## Hacker News / Reddit Post

**Title:** *BeamLine Scheduler: Polyglot distributed workflow orchestration (Erlang, C, C++, Rust, Phoenix)*

**Body:**

Hi HN/r/programming,

I've been working on BeamLine Scheduler—a distributed workflow orchestration platform built with a deliberate polyglot architecture. Instead of forcing everything into one language, each component uses the optimal tool:

**Architecture Overview:**
- C Gateway (C11): Ultra-low latency ingress (<1ms overhead)
- Erlang Router (OTP 26): Fault-tolerant orchestration with supervisor trees
- C++ Processor (CAF): Actor-based compute engine for CPU/GPU workloads
- Rust Worker (Tokio): Safe, async task execution with diverse handlers
- Phoenix UI (LiveView): Real-time management interface

**Performance:**
- 10,000+ HTTP req/s per gateway instance
- <100ms end-to-end latency (p95) for typical workflows
- 50,000+ routing decisions per second
- Linear horizontal scaling tested

**Production Features:**
- Full observability (Prometheus, OpenTelemetry, structured JSON logs)
- Kubernetes-native with health checks and auto-scaling
- Multi-tenant with resource quotas and isolation
- Comprehensive test coverage (80%+) and CI/CD
- Dead letter queues, circuit breakers, graceful degradation

**Tech Choices Explained:**
- Erlang: 30+ years of distributed systems battle-testing, supervisor trees for fault tolerance
- C: Minimal overhead for the hot path (gateway receives every request)
- C++/CAF: Actor model for fine-grained concurrency control
- Rust: Memory safety without GC for worker tasks (HTTP, DB, scripting)
