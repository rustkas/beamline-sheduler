## Composition Tips for Circular Avatar

- Keep main elements centered
- Important details should be within the "safe zone" (inner 70% of circle)
- Use radial or circular composition
- Balance elements symmetrically
- Ensure design works at small sizes (128x128px)
- Maintain clarity when cropped to circle
